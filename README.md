# How-does-landscape-heterogeneity-affect-bee-functional-traits
The data is from a systematic review on the relationship between bee functional traits and landscape heterogeneity. The complete text and in depth consideratios about this review is currently under revision to be published in OIKOS.

The data presented in these spreadsheets are systematic reviews of selected scientific articles from Scopus and Web of Knowledge platforms.

The first spreadsheet "paper_data" contains information of the analysed articles, such as year of publication, authors, title, DOI and so on.

The second spreadsheet "paper_details" is a matrix with information obtained from these articles on the relationship between bee functional traits and landscape heterogeneity. In tjis table it is possible to analyse the landscape heterogeneity types found and the functional traits analysed in each article, as well as the response of bee functional traits to landscape heterogeneity.

The remaining spreadsheets correspond to the responses of bee functional traits for each category of landscape heterogeneity separately.
