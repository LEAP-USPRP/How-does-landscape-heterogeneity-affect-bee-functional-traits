# How-does-landscape-heterogeneity-affect-bee-functional-trait
The data is from a systematic review of the relationship between bee functional traits and landscape heterogeneity. The complete text and in-depth considerations about this review is currently under revision to be published in OIKOS.

The data presented in these spreadsheets are systematic reviews of selected scientific articles from Scopus and Web of Knowledge platforms.

The first spreadsheet, "paper_data", contains information on the analysed articles, such as year of publication, authors, title, DOI, etc.

The second spreadsheet, "paper_details", is a matrix with information obtained from these articles on the relationship between bee functional traits and landscape heterogeneity. In this table, it is possible to analyse the landscape heterogeneity types found, the functional traits analysed in each article, and the response of bee functional traits to landscape heterogeneity.

The remaining spreadsheets correspond to the responses of bee functional traits for each category of landscape heterogeneity separately.

The data is presented in two formats: a .XLSX spreadsheet and a single .ZIP file containing all tables in .CSV format. The data in both formats is the same.
